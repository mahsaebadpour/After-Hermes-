**Review of Nadia’s thought piece**

The most persuasive aspect of your piece is how it aims to dive into the emotional aspect of a person. A psychological approach to a text of a novel that attempts to shed light on emotional challenges of the main character is very intriguing.
The research question can be put as trying to detect the patterns of different emotions of the main character and their impact on his demise.
The argument looks pretty feasible. For, by isolating each emotion and close-studying them, a definite ground for data base would be achieved. However, it seems that you have a very broad area to cover, especially considering the length of the novel and the fact that you have not previously approached this issue. Thus, you would have to work with a great amount of data. Perhaps you could narrow down the targeted emotions and try tracing them throughout the novel For instance, you could focus mainly on the connections between “fear” and “anger” rather than a wide range of various emotions.

The choice of media seems to suit the argument and the project in mind pretty well. A network visualization-especially in 3D- of the feelings and emotions of the main character can be a very clear portray of the patterns and relationships between them.

The idea of looking into the complexity of the Agnes Grey’s narrative, in attempt to unfold the different characteristics of the main character is very riveting. Your argument tends to get confusing as a result of the complex form of narration in the novel. Therefore, you might want to clarify the specific purpose behind your choice. This may be achieved through eliminating certain parts of the text which you intend to do.
 Media-rich narration seems like the most reasonable choice for the argument. You could perhaps display the altered version of the text primer to the original one, for this could make the change in the interpretation more tangible.


**Review of Matt’s thought piece**

The concept of art mirroring life is very alluring to me. Because to explore how an old fable would still raise same (or different) responses is very persuasive. 
The research question seems a little broad and confusing. I think you have a clear idea of what you want to argue; to make a text-based game adapted from the Tower of Babel to determine the response of the players. The only hiccup seems to be the method of monitoring and gathering the data. You mentioned adding a comment section which I think could be useful, but it could also be time-consuming and not accurate. Perhaps you could have an online poll for the players which would make analyzing the data seems to be more rapid and efficient.
