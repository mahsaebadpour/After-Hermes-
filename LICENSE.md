##Log 1: After Hermes?

All through Galloway’s argument reaching this claim, the most significant part that lured my attention in and then pulled me all the way to his assumption was when he told the Spinoza’s tale of transformation(26). He made an analogy of a grown-up infant and a light lost in the shadow which, for me, is just like a message trying to be delivered through the perplexing media today; lost in the spinning world of fast-paced sharing, a tiny light in the shadow failing to illuminate the context. 

The Platonic view of art as an imitation views the writing form of a pure thought as a second degree of the truth. And it seems to me that media is even remoter from the truth, for it is imitated three times, and this makes it deceptive and betraying. Although media can be the equal to writing in the sense that they both are images of the thought, media seems to estrange the thought and context much more than simply changing the format. To me Hermes, as Galloway puts it , is “lost”. Just like a complicated maze the contemporary media has spun into endless possibilities and eliminated any true and pure communication. 

Through the course that Galloway makes his assumptions about furies a protruding claim locked my attention; Furies reduce the mind to matter(63). This particular fixation that furies possess paints a world void of any productive or creative thought. A world that is embarking on an era of chaotic communication. This “infuriation of distributed systems” would be the bed for baffled scholars, who under the mask of pretentiousness will attack any discourse with swords of multiplicity. The scholars under this influence will twirl in the ocean of furies with no specific direction holding onto nothing but excommunication. Thus,they will ultimately drown in the post-hermeneutic shadow. With little light to shine upon the thought and the context, the post-hermeneutic era would be a swirl of arbitrary signs where interpretation and pure thought are banished.
