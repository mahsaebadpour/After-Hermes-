This present study examines the effects of six weather parameters (temperature, wind power, sunlight, precipitation, air pressure, and photoperiod) on mood (positive affect, negative affect, and tiredness). I am hoping the corpus of this work will provide me with insights into the existing associations between weather and mood to compare to the associations made in The great Gatsby by Fitzgerald.

Affective mapping” is the name Flatley gives to the aesthetic technology—in the older, more basic sense of a techne—that represents the historicity of one’s affective experience. In mapping out one’s affective life and its historicity, a political problem (such as racism or revolution) that may have been previously invisible, opaque, difﬁcult, abstract, and above all depressing may be transformed into one that is interesting, that solicits and rewards one’s attention. Since this work is mainly concerned with the study of nineteenth and twentieth centuries, it will help me have a better understanding of the affect in modernism and find out whether Fitzgerald was making associations in this frame or not.

While working on a project in which Jockers was applying the tools and techniques of sentiment analysis to works of fiction, he initially was interested in tracing the evolution of emotional content in novels over the course of the 19th century. By accident he discovered that the sentiment he was detecting and measuring in the fiction could be used as a highly accurate proxy for plot movement.
This work is a good sample of sentimental analysis that I will be looking into. The techniques and methods used in this research will be the basic text analysis for my project.

In my his recent work , Jockers have been attempting to model plot movement in narrative fiction by analyzing the rise and fall of emotional valence across narrative time. This analysis of emotions will be a valuable source for my research and I could make use of the models and techniques that Jockers employs.

<http://www.matthewjockers.net/2015/02/02/syuzhet>.
This article explores the relationship between sentiment and plot shape in fiction using an R package titled “syuzhet” . The package is designed to extract sentiment and plot information from prose. Methods for text import, sentiment extraction, and plot arc modeling are described in the documentation and in the package vignette. 
This package would be a handy tool for me to extract emotional and sentimental models and patterns in the great Gatsby.
**Kerr, Frances. "Feeling `Half Feminine': Modernism And The Politics Of Emotion In The Great Gatsby." American Literature 68.2 (1996): 405. America: History and Life with Full Text. Web. 17 Feb. 2015.**
This article illuminates how in 'The Great Gatsby' (1925), F. Scott Fitzgerald raises but does not resolve gender issues with which he was probably unable to cope. He both observed and dismantled distinctions between masculinity and femininity and their respective association with sentiment and vitality. I am mostly interested in the way the emotional associations are depicted in this article and it would a beneficial example for the research I will be undertaking.

The modernist privileging of irony and detached contemplation frequently combined with a recognition of the social and artistic significance of affect. The relation between melodramatic structures of feeling and modernist innovation is evident in two plays of the interwar years: Bertolt Brecht and Elisabeth Hauptmann's Happy End and W. H. Auden and Christopher Isherwood's On the Frontier. Scholars need to develop a vocabulary that complements the customary critical emphasis on modernist "irony," "estrangement," and "difficulty" and that can be used to reconstruct the full force of the modernist uses of affect.
Distinguishing the way modernist poets and writers exhibit affect in their works is of very much use for exploring Fitzgerald’s work , and discovering if he was also using traditional or typical associations.
**Kööts, L., A. Realo, and J. Allik. "the Influence of the Weather on Affective Experience: An Experience Sampling Study." Individual Differences 32.2 (2011): 74-84. Print.** 
This study examined the relationship between affective experiences and weather variables using an experience-sampling method. The moderating effects of personality and age on the relationship were also investigated.

The value of this research for me is in how depictions between weather and emotions have been made, and I would be able to use both the results and methods of the research to examine the patterns concerning weather and emotions used in The Great Gatsby. 

**Schmidt , Ben. "Typical TV Episodes: Visualizing Topics in Screen Time." Sapping Attention. 2014.Web. 17 Feb.2015. <http://sappingattention.blogspot.ca/2014/12/typical-tv-episodes-visualizing-topics.html>.**

What can we see by looking at the different content of TV shows? Are there elements to the ways that TV shows are laid out--common plot structures--that repeat? How thematically different is the end of a show from its beginning? Ben began by topic modeling the closed captioning data from a series of popular TV series and then visualizing the ten most common topics over the time span of each episode. In other words, the x-axis is time, and the y-axis is a measure of topical presence. The end result is something that begins to look a bit like what we could call plot.

Although Schmidt’s project is much lengthier than mine since it looks at a couple of hundred shows, I would be able to employ his means of modeling to a novel just as Jockers attempted to do. This work is especially useful in the sense that it divided the material into different sections (a corpus of 80,000 movies and TV show episodes into 3 minute chunks, and then divided each show into 12 roughly-equal parts)which is what I intend to do with Fitzgerald’s The Great Gatsby

**Scott, Robert Ian. "A Sense Of Loss: Entropy Vs. Ecology In The Great Gatsby." Queen's Quarterly 82.(1975): 559-571. MLA International Bibliography. Web. 17 Feb. 2015.**
In this article it is argued how Fitzgerald made the second law of thermodynamics movingly concrete with examples of the corrupting effects of time and wealth, which disorganize and then destroy the ecology, the complexly sensitive relationships on which life and hope depend.
This article makes lucid associations with ecology and various events of the story. There are also association s of different emotions i.e. Love with October night. I would be able to use the portrayed outlines in illustrating sentimental patterns throughout the story.


#Thought piece revised 

Perhaps I should also revise my heading since my thought piece is not so much revised as crumbled and tossed away. After much consideration along with a sudden realisation of the shortness of life and the length of my previous project, I decided to work on The Great Gatsby(at least the author is the same!).


Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby , the story of a young millionaire attempting desperately to gain the affection of his love, has been studied, wrote on , and analysed in every aspect;the decay of american dream , materialism, clash of different social classes and so forth. The greatness of the Gatsby-the book- is stemmed from the fact that it never fails to fascinate the readers. For there is always a new revelation gained while fiddling with this work of literature. Symbols and motifs are a strong element in the story and there has been a lot of emphasis on the green light and the eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg, leaving weather and its impact through out the story quite unnoticed. 

The weather in The Great Gatsby has strong symbolic imagery as well as a strong link to emotional state of the characters consequently affecting their course of actions. My intention is to take a close look at how different weather conditions define and change the emotions felt by different characters and how they determine the actions taken by the characters.

In other words, what is the extend of the impact that weather has on the characters' emotions and actions, and would altering the weather conditions modify those emotions and actions? 

New media can assist me in several ways to make the process more rapid and convenient. The first thing that comes to mind is , thanks to technology, the close reading of the novel and gathering a data base of all the weather conditions would be a faster process. Demonstration of the patterns in which weather conditions, emotions, and actions are connected is another advantage of using new media. 
My primary thought was to exhibit these relations in the form of a 3D network visualisation.  However, that was pre- Friday and before Dr. Sayers introduced me to Great Gatsby: The game. ( thus, the coolness of my project rocketed through the imaginary glass ceiling) 
There has been many adaptations of The Great Gatsby most interesting of which are games. You would be surprised how many results you get when you search Gatsby on Apple's AppStore! 

My plan is to creat a game -preferably text-based- with the main story line same as the book. Since my purpose is to find out should the weather conditions change, would the course of action of the characters also change or not, the players could either have the option to choose the weather condition in different levels of the game or the weather conditions will be altered in the game to monitor how the players' reaction change as apposed to characters in the book. The players could also be given the option to choose their character from Nick, Gatsby, or Daisy. 

My main concern is how to monitor the results and gather the data. I could consider having the players submit their score once finished playing, or have an online poll. 

To be able to creat this game I will need to master either Ruby or Python.

# Thought piece reviews 

**Review of Nadia’s thought piece**

The most persuasive aspect of your piece is how it aims to dive into the emotional aspect of a person. A psychological approach to a text of a novel that attempts to shed light on emotional challenges of the main character is very intriguing.
The research question can be put as trying to detect the patterns of different emotions of the main character and their impact on his demise.
The argument looks pretty feasible. For, by isolating each emotion and close-studying them, a definite ground for data base would be achieved. However, it seems that you have a very broad area to cover, especially considering the length of the novel and the fact that you have not previously approached this issue. Thus, you would have to work with a great amount of data. Perhaps you could narrow down the targeted emotions and try tracing them throughout the novel For instance, you could focus mainly on the connections between “fear” and “anger” rather than a wide range of various emotions.

The choice of media seems to suit the argument and the project in mind pretty well. A network visualization-especially in 3D- of the feelings and emotions of the main character can be a very clear portray of the patterns and relationships between them.

**Review of Elizabeth’s thought piece**


The idea of looking into the complexity of the Agnes Grey’s narrative, in attempt to unfold the different characteristics of the main character is very riveting. Your argument tends to get confusing as a result of the complex form of narration in the novel. Therefore, you might want to clarify the specific purpose behind your choice. This may be achieved through eliminating certain parts of the text which you intend to do.
 Media-rich narration seems like the most reasonable choice for the argument. You could perhaps display the altered version of the text primer to the original one, for this could make the change in the interpretation more tangible.


**Review of Matt’s thought piece**

The concept of art mirroring life is very alluring to me. Because to explore how an old fable would still raise same (or different) responses is very persuasive. 
The research question seems a little broad and confusing. I think you have a clear idea of what you want to argue; to make a text-based game adapted from the Tower of Babel to determine the response of the players. The only hiccup seems to be the method of monitoring and gathering the data. You mentioned adding a comment section which I think could be useful, but it could also be time-consuming and not accurate. Perhaps you could have an online poll for the players which would make analyzing the data  more rapid and efficient.


#Log2: Thought piece


Umar Khayyam was a polymath, scientist, philosopher, and poet of the 11th century CE. Although Umar Khayyam's Rubā‘iyyāt have been admired in the Persian speaking world for many centuries, they have only been known in the West since the mid 19th century, when Edward FitzGerald rendered the Rubā‘iyyāt into English. In his Rubā‘iyyāt, Khayyam challenged religious doctrines and casts doubt on them. The paradox of his philosophies where he refers to God as the “Necessary Being” and his Rubā‘iyyāt in which he exhibits skepticism is the subject of my interest. I aim to shed light upon his ideas and philosophies in Rubā‘iyyāt to determine which philosophy and thought he leaned towards. What shall we call the ideas that Khayyam expresses in Rubā‘iyyāt; theological or philosophical?  

The new media will help me search for the key concepts in Rubā‘iyyāt , gather data , and make a more efficient illustration with the use of audio and visual aids. 
There are a lot of religious, mythological allusions in this work that would be best demonstrated with the help of new media .Furthermore, the computation would be more rapid and precise than a normal close reading. Employing the new media will be of great assistance in comprehension and connecting of the concepts by engaging more of our senses. It will also illuminate the link between the allusions given in the text and Khayyam’s beliefs. 

I would like to demonstrate the piece by a long form, media-rich narrative since it would allow me to guide the argument through visual elements. This method would allow me to make distinct and clear demonstration of the allusions and imagery mentioned in the poem in order to come up with the patterns  linking them to Khayyam’s ideas. I intent to trace the various allusions and references in the work and then demonstrate them by either using a pre-existing visual media or creating 3D models. To expand the research I might portray the patterns and links between these images and his beliefs using graphs and network visualizations. 



The type of media that I will need to maser this recipe would be Scalar, CSS, and markdown.furthermore, D3.js, Python , and CityEngine. I intent to create a visually accessible piece that is both illuminating and educational.

#Mahsa's 507 log
##Log 1: After Hermes?

All through Galloway’s argument reaching his claim of hermeneutic interpretation and immanent iridescence withering away(62), the most significant part that lured my attention in and then pulled me all the way to this assumption was when he told the Spinoza’s tale of transformation(26). He made an analogy of a grown-up infant and a light lost in the shadow which, for me, is just like a message trying to be delivered through the perplexing media today; lost in the spinning world of fast-paced sharing, a tiny light in the shadow failing to illuminate the context. 

The Platonic view of art as an imitation views the writing form of a pure thought as a second degree of the truth. And it seems to me that media is even remoter from the truth, for it is imitated three times, and this makes it deceptive and betraying. Although media can be the equal to writing in the sense that they both are images of the thought, media seems to estrange the thought and context much more than simply changing the format. To me Hermes, as Galloway puts it , is “lost”. Just like a complicated maze the contemporary media has spun into endless possibilities and eliminated any true and pure communication. 

Through the course that Galloway makes his assumptions about furies a protruding claim locked my attention; Furies reduce the mind to matter(63). This particular fixation that furies possess paints a world void of any productive or creative thought. A world that is embarking on an era of chaotic communication. This “infuriation of distributed systems” would be the bed for baffled scholars, who under the mask of pretentiousness will attack any discourse with swords of multiplicity. The scholars under this influence will twirl in the ocean of furies with no specific direction holding onto nothing but excommunication. Thus,they will ultimately drown in the post-hermeneutic shadow. With little light to shine upon the thought and the context, the post-hermeneutic era would be a swirl of arbitrary signs where interpretation and pure thought are banished.
