#January 27,2015 Thought piece


Umar Khayyam was a polymath, scientist, philosopher, and poet of the 11th century CE. Although Umar Khayyam's Rubā‘iyyāt have been admired in the Persian speaking world for many centuries, they have only been known in the West since the mid 19th century, when Edward FitzGerald rendered the Rubā‘iyyāt into English. In his Rubā‘iyyāt, Khayyam challenged religious doctrines and casts doubt on them. The paradox of his philosophies where he refers to God as the “Necessary Being” and his Rubā‘iyyāt in which he exhibits skepticism is the subject of my interest. I aim to shed light upon his ideas and philosophies in Rubā‘iyyāt to determine which philosophy and thought he leaned towards. What shall we call the ideas that Khayyam expresses in Rubā‘iyyāt; theological or philosophical?  

The new media will help search for the key concepts in Rubā‘iyyāt , gather data , and make a more efficient illustration with the help of audio and visual aids. 
There are a lot of religious, mythological allusions in this work that would be best demonstrated with the help of new media .Furthermore, the computation would be more rapid and precise than a normal close reading. Employing the new media will be of great assistance in comprehension and connecting of the concepts by engaging more of our senses. It will also illuminate the link between the allusions given in the text and Khayyam’s beliefs.

I would like to demonstrate the piece by a long form, media-rich narrative since it would allow me to guide the argument through visual elements. This method would allow me to make distinct and clear demonstration of the allusions and imagery mentioned in the poem in order to come up with the patterns that link them to Khayyam’s ideas.

The type of media that I will need to maser this recipe would be Scalar, CSS, and markdown. I intent to create a visually accessible piece that is both illuminating and educational.

#Mahsa's 507 log
##Log 1: After Hermes?

All through Galloway’s argument reaching his claim of hermeneutic interpretation and immanent iridescence withering away(62), the most significant part that lured my attention in and then pulled me all the way to this assumption was when he told the Spinoza’s tale of transformation(26). He made an analogy of a grown-up infant and a light lost in the shadow which, for me, is just like a message trying to be delivered through the perplexing media today; lost in the spinning world of fast-paced sharing, a tiny light in the shadow failing to illuminate the context. 

The Platonic view of art as an imitation views the writing form of a pure thought as a second degree of the truth. And it seems to me that media is even remoter from the truth, for it is imitated three times, and this makes it deceptive and betraying. Although media can be the equal to writing in the sense that they both are images of the thought, media seems to estrange the thought and context much more than simply changing the format. To me Hermes, as Galloway puts it , is “lost”. Just like a complicated maze the contemporary media has spun into endless possibilities and eliminated any true and pure communication. 

Through the course that Galloway makes his assumptions about furies a protruding claim locked my attention; Furies reduce the mind to matter(63). This particular fixation that furies possess paints a world void of any productive or creative thought. A world that is embarking on an era of chaotic communication. This “infuriation of distributed systems” would be the bed for baffled scholars, who under the mask of pretentiousness will attack any discourse with swords of multiplicity. The scholars under this influence will twirl in the ocean of furies with no specific direction holding onto nothing but excommunication. Thus,they will ultimately drown in the post-hermeneutic shadow. With little light to shine upon the thought and the context, the post-hermeneutic era would be a swirl of arbitrary signs where interpretation and pure thought are banished.
