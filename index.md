##Panel Discussion
###Defiling the Text: Deformance and Religion in Scripture, Prose and Poetry
**Abstract:**
Typically literary criticism sees the primary text as sacred: deformance seeks to break that paradigm. When Lisa Samuels and Jerome McGann wrote “Deformance and Interpretation,” they demonstrated how the deformed text can lead to a better understanding of the original, yet to highlight the work of deformance they used highly formalized poetry as examples. This panel’s three projects exhibit both the original procedures of Samuels and McGann while expanding beyond genre and technique. Ashley Burr, in her project “The Religious Libertine” uses the technique of substitution to create a spectrum of deformed versions of John Wilmot, Second Earl of Rochester's poem "To the Postboy" that range from spiritual to sinful. In a departure from formalized poetry, Mahsa Ebadpour's project “Some Like it Hot” uses alteration to deform the weather patterns of F Scott Fitzgerald’s The Great Gatsby and show how heat can kill and rain can save. Lastly, in a literal act of heresy, Matthew McBride’s “A Dark Tower” uses user gameplay to reorder the biblical verses from Genesis 11 to blur the line between user and God, the Word and code, and performance and deformance.
**Introduction to Deformation:**
Lisa Samuels and Jerome McGann wrote an article titled "Deformance and Interpretation". Their concept of Deformance is defined as changing a text in order to explore underlying meanings. There are four types of deformative methods described: reordering, isolating, altering and adding. They claim that when you change the text it changes the way it functions and you can then see a different side of the piece, which can provoke new questions. This method as proposed by Samuels and McGann is on poetry our group has stretched this critique to read further and use deformation for more than they originally suggested, using prose and scripture in addition to poetry. All three of us have adapted this method in our own research in order to amplify our readings of various texts.
**Notes to talk about (my own project)**
I have been making use of close reading followed by deformance o depict weather patterns and their association with the emotional valance in Fitzgerald’s the great Gatsby. I am primarily concerned with deforming the content and observing in what ways it affects the form. 
Gatsby has been studied to death in various aspects. I, however, look into the weather patterns, for I suspected an existing association between weather conditions and emotions in the novel. 
I primarily started with close reading the text to determine areas to focus on and parts of the text to employ deformance to.
Therefore, I prepared a spread sheet and as I was reading through the novel I came upon several instances of mention of the weather. The first significant one was Nick’s reunion with Daisy; a day full of conflict and tension.
One of the most important ones was in chapter five where Gatsby and Daisy meet after five years. Although it is raining all throughout the incident this chapter is emotionally the most positive one. 
I, using python, looked into how many times a certain word was repeated and in this chapter the word “rain” was mentioned about half as much as it was repeated in the whole novel.
I have modified a short passage from the part that leads the characters into plaza and ultimately the three deaths.  I deformed the text by replacing the weather indictors –in this case specifically words related to heat- with opposite ones. This alteration changes the plot and the story in a way that prevents the demise of three characters.
I also ran an emotional analysis through the whole novel using Matthew Jockers’ syuzhet package which looks into the structure of narrative by means of sentimental analysis and reveals emotional and effectual shifts that cause the narrative movement between conflict and conflict resolution.[Jockers, 2014]
This analysis revealed a positive association of emotions with rain and a negative one with the sun and heat. 
So the question why Fitzgerald was using these associations needed to be addressed.  The scientific study of the way weather affects the mood sowed no indication of an association. And since the cultural and social background belief about the link between rainy weather and mood is a negative one, it could not be a possible source for Fitzgerald’s use of weather.
It is interesting to note that Fitzgerald quotes Edward Thomas’s poem “the rain” in Gatsby: “blessed are the dead that rain falls on” assuming that he did not merely copy the sentence and there must be more reasons as to why rain is a sign of bliss I looked into religion. 
Thomas Dilworth argues that Gatsby is an evocation of Jesus (119) and interestingly enough I found several quotes from the bible espousing the idea that these associations might have been religious.
   **Script**
The original text (Matt)
The next day was broiling, almost the last, certainly the warmest, of
the summer.
. . . Through the hall of the Buchanans' house blew a faint wind,
carrying the sound of the telephone bell out to Gatsby and me as we
waited at the door.
The room, shadowed well with awnings, was dark and cool. Daisy and
Jordan lay upon an enormous couch, like silver idols, weighing down
their own white dresses against the singing breeze of the fans.
"Make us a cold drink," cried Daisy.
Tom came back,
preceding four gin rickeys that clicked full of ice.

Gatsby took up his drink.

"They certainly look cool," he said, with visible tension.

We drank in long greedy swallows.

"What'll we do with ourselves this afternoon," cried Daisy, "and the
day after that, and the next thirty years?"

"Don't be morbid," Jordan said. "Life starts all over again when it gets
crisp in the fall."

"But it's so hot," insisted Daisy, on the verge of tears, "And
everything's so confused. Let's all go to town!"

"All right," broke in Tom quickly, "I'm perfectly willing to go to
town. Come on--we're all going to town."

They went upstairs to get ready while we three men stood there shuffling
the hot pebbles with our feet.


"Shall we all go in my car?" suggested Gatsby. He felt the hot, green
leather of the seat. "I ought to have left it in the shade."

"Is it standard shift?" demanded Tom.

"Yes."

"Well, you take my coupé and let me drive your car to town."

The suggestion was distasteful to Gatsby.

"I don't think there's much gas," he objected.

"Plenty of gas," said Tom boisterously. He looked at the gauge.
"And if it runs out I can stop at a drug store. You can buy anything at a
drug store nowadays."

We were all irritable now with the fading ale and, aware of it,
we drove for a while in silence. Then as Doctor T. J. Eckleburg's faded
eyes came into sight down the road, I remembered Gatsby's caution about
gasoline.

"We've got enough to get us to town," said Tom.

"But there's a garage right here," objected Jordan. "I don't want to get
stalled in this baking heat."

Tom threw on both brakes impatiently and we slid to an abrupt
dusty stop under Wilson's sign.


The deformed text (Ashley)

The next day was cool, almost the last, certainly the coolest, of
the summer. 

. . . Through the hall of the Buchanans' house blew a faint wind,
carrying the sound of the telephone bell out to Gatsby and me as we
waited at the door.


The room, shadowed well with awnings, was dark and cool. Daisy and
Jordan lay upon an enormous couch, like silver idols, weighing down
their own white dresses against the heat of the radiators.

"We can't move," they said together.

"Make us a hot cup of tea," cried Daisy.


Tom came back,
preceding four cups of tea that steam rose from in the cold.

Gatsby took up his tea.

"They certainly look hot," he said, with visible tension.

We drank in long greedy swallows. Sitting on the big couch, they sipped the warm tea and relaxed in the comfort that the cold lurking outside is trapped in the wind. 

[]

"What'll we do with ourselves this afternoon," cried Daisy, "and the
day after that, and the next thirty years?"

"Don't be morbid," Jordan said. "Life starts all over again when it gets
crisp in the fall."

"But it's so cold," insisted Daisy, on the verge of tears, "And
everything's so confused. Let's all go to town!"

Her voice struggled on through the cold, beating against it, moulding its
senselessness into forms.

"Who wants to go to town?" demanded Daisy insistently. Gatsby's eyes
floated toward her. "Ah," she cried, "you look so cool."


"All right," broke in Tom quickly, "I'm perfectly willing to go to
town. Come on--we're all going to town."


His hand, trembling with his effort at self control, bore to his lips the
last of his glass of ale. Daisy's voice got us to our feet and out on
to the freezing gravel drive.

"Are we just going to go?" she objected. "Like this? Aren't we going to
let any one smoke a cigarette first?"

"Shall we all go in my car?" suggested Gatsby. He felt the cool, green
leather of the seat. 

"Is it standard shift?" demanded Tom.

"Yes."

"Well, we will meet you up in town."

[The suggestion was distasteful to Gatsby.

"I don't think there's much gas," he objected.

"Plenty of gas," said Tom boisterously. He looked at the gauge.
"And if it runs out I can stop at a drug store. You can buy anything at a

we drove for a while in silence. Then as Doctor T. J. Eckleburg's faded
eyes came into sight down the road, I remembered Gatsby's caution about
gasoline.

"We've got enough to get us to town," said Tom.

"But there's a garage right here," objected Jordan. "I don't want to get
stalled in this crisp(cool) chill/mild chill."

Tom threw on both brakes impatiently and we slid to an abrupt
dusty stop under Wilson's sign. After a moment the proprietor emerged
from the interior of his establishment and gazed hollow-eyed at the car.

"Let's have some gas!" cried Tom roughly. "What do you think we stopped
for--to admire the view?"]

##Abstract



Lisa Samuels and Jerome McGann's "Deformance and Interpretation" discusses a new form of literary critique. Their concept of deformance is based on the claim that when you change the text it changes the way it functions, and you can then see a different side of the piece which can provoke new questions and answers. There are four types of deformative methods described: reordering, isolating, altering and adding. Three texts have been deformed using various techniques of deformance critique. The first technique of text alteration is applied to John Wilmot, Second Earl of Rochester's poem "To the Postboy".  A spectrum of deformed poems from libertine to religious were produced to uncover the sincerity of Rochester's religious conversion in 1680. The second text being looked at through deformance critique is Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby in which the impact of weather conditions regarding the sentimental and consequential aspects has been determined ;an extraction of weather and sentimental associations from the plot by modifying the text. The final text utilizing deformation is the Tower of Babel, wherein the sequence of events prove integral to the traditional interpretation and meaning of the text. To deform the original text and reveal other possible interpretations or meanings from the text, _A Tower_ reorganizes passages and events in the biblical story of Babel according to user gameplay. As a result, the game blurs the lines between user and God, the Word and code, and performance and deformance. These three arguments adapted methods of deformation in order to better understand the way these pieces work and how the results reflect on the text as a whole.

##Where I am 

The effect of weather conditions on the plot in The Great Gatsby goes quite far. Through close reading of the novel and extracting the weather patterns it has been pointed out that all three deaths occurring in the novel would be completely avoided if the weather condition was altered. The season being summer and weather being “broiling” the characters decide to drive to New York, swap cars, and stop at the garage. Furthermore, the associations made between various weather conditions and emotional state of characters- often even the story- is not typical. Reunions are made in the rain and murders happen in baking heat of a sunny day. I would still have to look into the scientific influence weather plays on the psyche and ideally find a source to determine the associations made in other 20th century fictions for the sake of comparison. I have altered almost all the weather patterns in the main text and now I am in midst of running a sentimental analysis using Matthew Jockers’ “Syzhuet” package. This would help to better compare different chapters with each other and also the deformed text with the original one. 


I would like to share my work with public on my Github. However, I’d prefer to do it after (if) I publish.

I would also like to make my data and method, aside from my essay, discoverable.








#March 3rd , Abstract 


**Moody Gatsby, who is to blame; Rain or Sunshine?**
 
 
  **The almighty weather: Exploring weather patterns of Fitzgerald’s “The Great Gatsby” to determine sentimental associations** 

Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby has been a popular subject among researchers. It has been written on excessively in various aspects; the decay of American dream, materialism, clash of different social classes and so forth. The greatness of the Gatsby is stemmed from the fact that it never fails to provide the reader with a fresh perspective. Symbols are strong elements in the story and while there has been a lot of emphasis on the green light and the eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg, weather conditions and their impact throughout the story have remained quite unnoticed. The weather in The Great Gatsby has a strong link to emotional state of the characters ; consequently, affecting their course of action. This paper takes a closer look at how different weather conditions impact the characters’ emotions and raises the question that should the weather conditions alter, would those emotions be modified ,or not? Primarily, I will take on the task of reading the novel and manually gathering key terms related to the weather to identify all the common references in the text. Entering the extracted terms into a text file, I will study all the extractions and systematically replace them using Find/Replace in text editor. Once this replacement has been made, the weather patterns in Gatsby will change and I would be able to determine if the “deformed” text speaks to emotion or sentiment. This project hopes to shed light on the sentimental and weather associations that Fitzgerald employs in The Great Gatsby.

**Scope**

Initially, I was interested in creating a game -preferably text based- with the main story line same as the book and alter weather conditions to monitor how the players' reaction change compared to characters in the book. However, I will not afford the time to undertake this project during the semester.

P.S. I also couldn’t decide on the title.

**Concerns**

At this point I cannot decide on the alterations that are to be made on the weather patterns. I would like to have your suggestions on what kind of pattern you think I should use? Should I ,for example, change the “positive” terms (i.e. sunshine) with “negative” ones ( i.e. rain) ? I would be very glad to hear what other systems you could think of to use here.

This study examines the effects of six weather parameters (temperature, wind power, sunlight, precipitation, air pressure, and photoperiod) on mood (positive affect, negative affect, and tiredness). I am hoping that the corpus of this work will provide me with insights into the existing associations between weather and mood in order to compare to the associations made in The great Gatsby.

"Affective mapping” is the name Flatley gives to the aesthetic technology—in the older, more basic sense of a techne—that represents the historicity of one’s affective experience. In mapping out one’s affective life and its historicity, a political problem (such as racism or revolution) that may have been previously invisible, opaque, difﬁcult, abstract, and above all depressing may be transformed into one that is interesting, that solicits and rewards one’s attention. Since this work is mainly concerned with the study of nineteenth and twentieth centuries, it will help me gain a better understanding of "affect" in modernism and find out whether or not Fitzgerald was making associations within this frame .

<http://www.matthewjockers.net/2014/06/05/a-novel-method-for-detecting-plot>. 

While working on a project in which Jockers was applying the tools and techniques of sentiment analysis to works of fiction, he initially was interested in tracing the evolution of emotional content in novels over the course of the 19th century. By accident he discovered that the sentiment he was detecting and measuring in the fiction could be used as a highly accurate proxy for plot movement.
This work is a good sample of sentimental analysis that I will be looking into. The techniques and methods used in this research will be the basic text analysis for my project.

<http://www.matthewjockers.net/2015/01/05/plot-arcs-schmidt-style>. 

In my his recent work , Jockers have been attempting to model plot movement in narrative fiction by analyzing the rise and fall of emotional valence across narrative time. This analysis of emotions will be a valuable source for my research and I could make use of the models and techniques that Jockers employs.

<http://www.matthewjockers.net/2015/02/02/syuzhet>.

This article explores the relationship between sentiment and plot shape in fiction using an R package titled “syuzhet” .The package is designed to extract sentiment and plot information from prose. Methods for text import, sentiment extraction, and plot arc modeling are described in the documentation and in the package vignette. 
This package would be a handy tool for me to extract emotional and sentimental models and patterns from the great Gatsby.

This article illuminates how in 'The Great Gatsby' (1925), F. Scott Fitzgerald raises but does not resolve gender issues with which he was probably unable to cope. He both observed and dismantled distinctions between masculinity and femininity and their respective association with sentiment and vitality. I am mostly interested in the way the emotional associations are depicted in this article and it would a beneficial example for the same task that I will be undertaking in The Great Gatsby.

The modernist privileging of irony and detached contemplation frequently combined with a recognition of the social and artistic significance of affect. The relation between melodramatic structures of feeling and modernist innovation is evident in two plays of the interwar years: Bertolt Brecht and Elisabeth Hauptmann's Happy End and W. H. Auden and Christopher Isherwood's On the Frontier. Scholars need to develop a vocabulary that complements the customary critical emphasis on modernist "irony," "estrangement," and "difficulty" and that can be used to reconstruct the full force of the modernist uses of affect.
Distinguishing the way modernist poets and writers exhibit affect in their works is of very much use for exploring Fitzgerald’s work , and discovering through comparison if he was also using traditional and typical associations.

This study examined the relationship between affective experiences and weather variables using an experience-sampling method. The moderating effects of personality and age on the relationship were also investigated.

The value of this research for me is in how depictions between weather and emotions have been made, and I would be able to use both the results and methods of the research to examine the patterns concerning weather and emotions used in The Great Gatsby. 

**Schmidt , Ben. "Typical TV Episodes: Visualizing Topics in Screen Time." Sapping Attention. 2014.Web. 17 Feb.2015.**

<http://sappingattention.blogspot.ca/2014/12/typical-tv-episodes-visualizing-topics.html>.

What can we see by looking at the different content of TV shows? Are there elements to the ways that TV shows are laid out--common plot structures--that repeat? How thematically different is the end of a show from its beginning? Ben began by topic modeling the closed captioning data from a series of popular TV series and then visualizing the ten most common topics over the time span of each episode. In other words, the x-axis is time, and the y-axis is a measure of topical presence. The end result is something that begins to look a bit like what we could call plot.

Although Schmidt’s project is much lengthier than mine (since it looks at a couple of hundred shows), I would be able to employ his means of modeling to a novel just as Jockers attempted to do. This work is especially useful in the sense that it divided the material into different sections (a corpus of 80,000 movies and TV show episodes into 3 minute chunks, and then divided each show into 12 roughly-equal parts)which is what I intend to do with Fitzgerald’s The Great Gatsby

In this article it is argued how Fitzgerald made the second law of thermodynamics movingly concrete with examples of the corrupting effects of time and wealth, which disorganize and then destroy the ecology, the complexly sensitive relationships on which life and hope depend.
This article makes lucid associations with ecology and various events of the story. There are also associations detected between different emotions and various times of the year i.e. Love with October night. I would be able to use the portrayed outlines in this study to illustrate sentimental patterns throughout The Great Gatsby.


#Thought piece revised 

Perhaps I should also revise my heading since my thought piece is not so much revised as crumbled and tossed away. After much consideration along with a sudden realisation of the shortness of life and the length of my previous project, I decided to work on The Great Gatsby(at least the author is the same!).


Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby , the story of a young millionaire attempting desperately to gain the affection of his love, has been studied, wrote on , and analysed in every aspect;the decay of american dream , materialism, clash of different social classes and so forth. The greatness of the Gatsby-the book- is stemmed from the fact that it never fails to fascinate the readers. For there is always a new revelation gained while fiddling with this work of literature. Symbols and motifs are a strong element in the story and there has been a lot of emphasis on the green light and the eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg, leaving weather and its impact through out the story quite unnoticed. 

The weather in The Great Gatsby has strong symbolic imagery as well as a strong link to emotional state of the characters consequently affecting their course of actions. My intention is to take a close look at how different weather conditions define and change the emotions felt by different characters and how they determine the actions taken by the characters.

In other words, what is the extend of the impact that weather has on the characters' emotions and actions, and would altering the weather conditions modify those emotions and actions? 

New media can assist me in several ways to make the process more rapid and convenient. The first thing that comes to mind is , thanks to technology, the close reading of the novel and gathering a data base of all the weather conditions would be a faster process. Demonstration of the patterns in which weather conditions, emotions, and actions are connected is another advantage of using new media. 
My primary thought was to exhibit these relations in the form of a 3D network visualisation.  However, that was pre- Friday and before Dr. Sayers introduced me to Great Gatsby: The game. ( thus, the coolness of my project rocketed through the imaginary glass ceiling) 
There has been many adaptations of The Great Gatsby most interesting of which are games. You would be surprised how many results you get when you search Gatsby on Apple's AppStore! 

My plan is to creat a game -preferably text-based- with the main story line same as the book. Since my purpose is to find out should the weather conditions change, would the course of action of the characters also change or not, the players could either have the option to choose the weather condition in different levels of the game or the weather conditions will be altered in the game to monitor how the players' reaction change as apposed to characters in the book. The players could also be given the option to choose their character from Nick, Gatsby, or Daisy. 

My main concern is how to monitor the results and gather the data. I could consider having the players submit their score once finished playing, or have an online poll. 

To be able to creat this game I will need to master either Ruby or Python.

# Thought piece reviews 

**Review of Nadia’s thought piece**

The most persuasive aspect of your piece is how it aims to dive into the emotional aspect of a person. A psychological approach to a text of a novel that attempts to shed light on emotional challenges of the main character is very intriguing.
The research question can be put as trying to detect the patterns of different emotions of the main character and their impact on his demise.
The argument looks pretty feasible. For, by isolating each emotion and close-studying them, a definite ground for data base would be achieved. However, it seems that you have a very broad area to cover, especially considering the length of the novel and the fact that you have not previously approached this issue. Thus, you would have to work with a great amount of data. Perhaps you could narrow down the targeted emotions and try tracing them throughout the novel For instance, you could focus mainly on the connections between “fear” and “anger” rather than a wide range of various emotions.

The choice of media seems to suit the argument and the project in mind pretty well. A network visualization-especially in 3D- of the feelings and emotions of the main character can be a very clear portray of the patterns and relationships between them.

**Review of Elizabeth’s thought piece**


The idea of looking into the complexity of the Agnes Grey’s narrative, in attempt to unfold the different characteristics of the main character is very riveting. Your argument tends to get confusing as a result of the complex form of narration in the novel. Therefore, you might want to clarify the specific purpose behind your choice. This may be achieved through eliminating certain parts of the text which you intend to do.
 Media-rich narration seems like the most reasonable choice for the argument. You could perhaps display the altered version of the text primer to the original one, for this could make the change in the interpretation more tangible.


**Review of Matt’s thought piece**

The concept of art mirroring life is very alluring to me. Because to explore how an old fable would still raise same (or different) responses is very persuasive. 
The research question seems a little broad and confusing. I think you have a clear idea of what you want to argue; to make a text-based game adapted from the Tower of Babel to determine the response of the players. The only hiccup seems to be the method of monitoring and gathering the data. You mentioned adding a comment section which I think could be useful, but it could also be time-consuming and not accurate. Perhaps you could have an online poll for the players which would make analyzing the data  more rapid and efficient.


#Log2: Thought piece


Umar Khayyam was a polymath, scientist, philosopher, and poet of the 11th century CE. Although Umar Khayyam's Rubā‘iyyāt have been admired in the Persian speaking world for many centuries, they have only been known in the West since the mid 19th century, when Edward FitzGerald rendered the Rubā‘iyyāt into English. In his Rubā‘iyyāt, Khayyam challenged religious doctrines and casts doubt on them. The paradox of his philosophies where he refers to God as the “Necessary Being” and his Rubā‘iyyāt in which he exhibits skepticism is the subject of my interest. I aim to shed light upon his ideas and philosophies in Rubā‘iyyāt to determine which philosophy and thought he leaned towards. What shall we call the ideas that Khayyam expresses in Rubā‘iyyāt; theological or philosophical?  

The new media will help me search for the key concepts in Rubā‘iyyāt , gather data , and make a more efficient illustration with the use of audio and visual aids. 
There are a lot of religious, mythological allusions in this work that would be best demonstrated with the help of new media .Furthermore, the computation would be more rapid and precise than a normal close reading. Employing the new media will be of great assistance in comprehension and connecting of the concepts by engaging more of our senses. It will also illuminate the link between the allusions given in the text and Khayyam’s beliefs. 

I would like to demonstrate the piece by a long form, media-rich narrative since it would allow me to guide the argument through visual elements. This method would allow me to make distinct and clear demonstration of the allusions and imagery mentioned in the poem in order to come up with the patterns  linking them to Khayyam’s ideas. I intent to trace the various allusions and references in the work and then demonstrate them by either using a pre-existing visual media or creating 3D models. To expand the research I might portray the patterns and links between these images and his beliefs using graphs and network visualizations. 



The type of media that I will need to maser this recipe would be Scalar, CSS, and markdown.furthermore, D3.js, Python , and CityEngine. I intent to create a visually accessible piece that is both illuminating and educational.

#Mahsa's 507 log
##Log 1: After Hermes?

All through Galloway’s argument reaching his claim of hermeneutic interpretation and immanent iridescence withering away(62), the most significant part that lured my attention in and then pulled me all the way to this assumption was when he told the Spinoza’s tale of transformation(26). He made an analogy of a grown-up infant and a light lost in the shadow which, for me, is just like a message trying to be delivered through the perplexing media today; lost in the spinning world of fast-paced sharing, a tiny light in the shadow failing to illuminate the context. 

The Platonic view of art as an imitation views the writing form of a pure thought as a second degree of the truth. And it seems to me that media is even remoter from the truth, for it is imitated three times, and this makes it deceptive and betraying. Although media can be the equal to writing in the sense that they both are images of the thought, media seems to estrange the thought and context much more than simply changing the format. To me Hermes, as Galloway puts it , is “lost”. Just like a complicated maze the contemporary media has spun into endless possibilities and eliminated any true and pure communication. 

Through the course that Galloway makes his assumptions about furies a protruding claim locked my attention; Furies reduce the mind to matter(63). This particular fixation that furies possess paints a world void of any productive or creative thought. A world that is embarking on an era of chaotic communication. This “infuriation of distributed systems” would be the bed for baffled scholars, who under the mask of pretentiousness will attack any discourse with swords of multiplicity. The scholars under this influence will twirl in the ocean of furies with no specific direction holding onto nothing but excommunication. Thus,they will ultimately drown in the post-hermeneutic shadow. With little light to shine upon the thought and the context, the post-hermeneutic era would be a swirl of arbitrary signs where interpretation and pure thought are banished.
